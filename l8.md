# Introduction to StereoVision

Sterovision's most important task is to infer depth from images taken at the same time by two or more cameras.

## Basic Perspective Projection

Image point $p=(x,y,f)$\
Scene point $P=(X,Y,Z)$\
Perspective projections equations:\
$x=f\frac{X}{Z}$ and $y=f\frac{Y}{Z}$

## Why Stereo Vision

Fundamental ambigiuty: any point on the ray OP has image p;

$x = f \frac{kX}{kZ}$ and same with y

A second camera can resolve the ambiguity, enabling measurement of depth via triangulation.

## Parallax

parallax - motion of scene features located at different distances

Very distance object has small displacement, nearby objects has large displacement.

*General idea of stereo - infer distance to scene points by measuring parallax*

Anaglyphs are a way of encoging parallax in a single picture

## Stereo psychopisics

There existed an early debate: do we infer depth from higher-level information like perspective and contours, or does it occurs at a much lower level?

```Wheatstone and fellow physicist Sir David Brewster```

Obviously perspective and contours are important,
(particularly for monocular depth perception), but are
they necessary for binocular stereo depth perception?\
Bela Julesz answered this question in 1960 with his
experiments with random dot stereograms.

Generate a random dot pattern using a computer. By definition, this is just “noise”, so there are
obviously no monocular depth cues here.
Clip out a square region and shift it to the left.
Fill in the “hole” left behind with more random dots.
Now view as a stereo pair.

## Stereograms

Another method of encoding parallax in a single
image. Subtle shifts of repeated texture encode
disparity of depths in a scene (a technique made
famous under the “Magic Eye” brand name).
Unlike anaglyphs, you don’t need special glasses
to see these, just some practice focusing your eyes
behind the page.

## Simple stereo System

left cam loc at $(0,0,0)$, right cam loc at $(T_x,0,0)$. Otherwise cameras are identical (orientation and focal lenghts).\
Insight: translating camera to the right by $T_x$ is eq to leaving the camera stationary and translating the world to the left by $T_x$

*Left camera*: $x_l = f \frac{X}{Z}$, $y_l = f \frac{Y}{Z}$\
*Right camera*: $x_r = f \frac{X - T_x}{Z}$, $y_l = f \frac{Y}{Z}$\
*Stereo disparity*: $d = x_l - x_r = \frac{fT_x}{Z}$

Z - depth, T_x - baseline, d - disparity.\
Depth and disparity are inversely proportional, so literally disparity === parallax.
