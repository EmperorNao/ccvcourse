## Robust estimation (RANSAC)

Let's say we have found point matches between two images. We think they are related by some parametrics transformation. How do we estimate the parameters?

LS, but there is problem with outliers.

## Robust estimation

View estimation as a two-stage process
- classify data points as outliers or inliers
- fit model to inliers while ignoring outliers

$p = 1 - (1 - (1 - e)^s)^N$

We can get N from this eq.
