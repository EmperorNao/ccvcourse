# Stereo Algorithms

## Computing disparity

Corrspondence problem:
 - Determining which pixel in the right image corresponds to each pixel in the left image

We need to recall disc of computing corr of image patches: SSD and NCC

## Epipolar constraint

*Important concept*: for stereo matchinf we don't have to search the whole 2D right image for a corresponding point.

Epipolar constraint reduces search space to a one-dimensional line.

Diff stereo images had same y coord - that is epipolar line.

For a patch in left image
compare with patches along
same row in right image.
Select patch with highest
match score.
Repeat for all pixels in
left image.


## Adding Inter-Scanline Consistency
Each left image patch has been matched
independently along the right epipolar line.
This can lead to errors.
We would like to enforce some consistency
among matches in the same row (scanline).

First we introduce the concept of DSI (Disparity Space Image).
The DSI for one row represents pairwise match scores
between patches along that row in the left and right image.\
$C(i, j) =$ Match score for patch centered at left pixel i with patch centered at right pixel j.\
We will take some locality over diagonal and named it DSI.\
We need to find lowest cost path from start to finish. Important constraint that next point must be in next row or/and next col for current pair $i,j$. If or, that means some pixel is occluded, if and that means match.\
Easy solving by DP.\
$C(i, j) = min([C(i - 1, j - 1) + dissim(i, j), C(i, j - 1) + occlusionConstant, C(i - 1, j) + occlusionConstant])$.\
Fill in left occluded pixels with value from the
nearest valid pixel preceding it in the scanline, in right look for it in rigth.
