### Smoothing

Noise in image is a big trouble for derivative operator, num.div also can amplify noise

We can try to get rid of noise by using some local pixel averaging, so this maybe will remove noise and don't come much biasing

Smoothing:

1. Box filter \
$K = \frac{np.ones((n, n))}{n^2}$

2. Gaussian \
$K = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} exp(-\frac{x^2 +y^2}{2\sigma^2})$ \
normalize K such thats sum over K = 1

Also we can combine Smooth and Deriv kernels.
