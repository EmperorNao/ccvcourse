### Harris Corner Detection

Many CV tasks require finding corresponds in different views. Elements to be matched are image patches of fixed size. \
N.B: not all patches are created equal.

#### Corners

- Corner is intersection of contours.
- Corner is more stable feature for matching across different views

Basic idea of corner points: 
We should easily recognize the point by looking
at intensity values within a small window.\
Shifting the window in any direction should yield
a large change in appearance.

#### Harris Corner Detector

- 'flat region': no change in any direction
- 'edge': no change along the edge direction
- 'corner': significant changes in all directions

Change of intensity for she shift $[u, v]$:\
$E(u, v) = \sum_{x,y}w(x, y)[I(x + u, y + v) - I(x, y)]^2$ \
$w(x, y) =$ 1 in window, 0 outside OR gaussian

For nearly constant patches, this will be near 0.\
For very distinctive patches, this will be larger.\
Hence... we want patches where E(u,v) is LARGE.

#### Formulas
By using first order Taylor aprox:\
$f(x + u, y + v) = f(x, y) + uf_x(x,y) + vf_y(x, y)$
We can rewrite $E(u, v)=$ \
$
\begin{bmatrix}
u & v \\
\end{bmatrix} 
(\sum
\begin{bmatrix}
I_x^2 & I_x I_y\\
I_x I_y & I_y^2
\end{bmatrix}
)
\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v 
\end{bmatrix} $

For small shifts we have bilinear aprox, where matrix is computed from image derivatives

Classification using eigenvalues of matrix:

$\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are small, E is almost constant in each dir - flat region
$\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are large, E increases in all directions - corner
$\lambda_1$ or $\lambda_2$ large, other is small - edge

### Corner Response Measure

$R = detM - k(trace M) ^ 2$\
$detM = \lambda_1 \lambda_2$\
$traceM = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$\
k is an emperical determined constant; k ~ 0.04 - 0.06

- R depends only on eigenvalues
- R is large for corners
- R is negative for edge with large magnitude
- |R| is small for flat region

### Sobel operator

Compute I as [sobel operator](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Оператор_Собеля).

### Harris Corner Detection

1. Compute x and y deriv of image\
    $I_x = G^x_{\sigma} \cdot I $\
    $I_y = G^y_{\sigma} \cdot I $
2. Compute product of derivatives at every pixel\
    $I_{x^2} = I_x I_x$ \
    $I_{y^2} = I_y I_y$ \
    $I_{xy} = I_x I_y$
3. Compute the sums of the products of derivatives at each pixel
    $S_{x^2} = G_{\sigma'} I_{x^2}$ \
    $S_{y^2} = G_{\sigma'} I_{y^2}$\
    $S_{xy}  = G_{\sigma'} I_{xy} $
4. Define at each pixel (x, y) the matrix\
    $\begin{bmatrix}
    S_{x^2} & S_{xy}\\
    S_{xy} & S_{y^2}
    \end{bmatrix}
    $
5. Compute the responses at each pixel\
    $R = Det(H) - k(Trace(H))^2$
6. Threshold on value of R. Compute nonmax suppression
