## Estimating a Transformation

Let's say we have found point matches between two images, and we think they are related by some parametrics transformation.\
How do we estimate the parameters of that transformation?

General strategy: least-squares estimation from point correspondences.

Once we have estimated a transformation, how can we (un)warp image pixel values to produce a new picture.

Given a transformation between two images, we want to watp one image into the coordinate system of the other.
From source to destination.

## Forward warping

- For each pixel x in the source image
- Determine where it goes as $H(x)$
- Color the destination pixel

But it can leave gaps

## Backward warping with no gaps

- For each pixel x in the destination image
- Determine where it comes from as $H^{-1}(x)$
- Get color from that location

## Interpolation

- Nearest Neighbor: Take color of pixel with closest center
- Bilinear: weighted average
