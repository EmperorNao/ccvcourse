### Template matching

Key idea: Convolution (and cross corelation) with a filter can be viewed as a comparing a little 'picture' of what you want to find against all local regions in the image.\
So we can try to cut patch from an image, then try to convolve them with other images.\
Vision tasks requires matching two or more views.\
Assumptions:
- Most scene points are visible in both images
- Corresponding image regions are similar\
This assumptions holds if the distance of points from the cameras is much larger than the distance between cameras.

#### Task

Given an element in the left image, search for the corr element in right image.\
We need geom constraints to reduce the size of the search space.\
We must choose elements to match and similarity measure to compare.

Exists two classes of algorithms:
- Correlation-based algorithms produces a DENSE set of correspondences.
- Feature-based algorithms produces a SPARSE set of correspondeces.

#### Correlation-based algorithms

Some possible measures:
- $\max_{[i, j] \in \R}|f(i, j) - g(i, j)|$ 
- $\sum_{[i, j] \in \R}|f(i, j) - g(i, j)|$ \
Most popular:
- $SSD = \sum_{[i, j] \in \R}(f(i, j) - g(i, j))^2$
- $C_{fg} = \sum_{[i, j] \in \R}f(i, j) g(i, j)$

#### Problem with Correlation of Raw Image Templates

by multiply second image twice, we incr corr score twice. So if second image is brighter it will produce wrong results. So we need to subtract mean value of the template

### SSD or block matching
$SSD = \sum_{[i, j] \in \R}(f(i, j) - g(i, j))^2$

1) The most popular
2) We used it in Harris Detector

SSD has correlation in itself ($2*f*g$)

When a scene is imaged by different sensors, or under
different illumination intensities, both the SSD and
the Cfg can be large for windows representing the same
area in the scene.\
A solution is to NORMALIZE the pixels in the windows
before comparing them by subtracting the mean of the
patch intensities and dividing by the std.dev.\
$\hat{f} = (f - mean(f))/(std(f))$\
$\hat{g} = (g - mean(g))/(std(g))$

Normalice CC is better, also is has property of be in range from -1 to 1.
