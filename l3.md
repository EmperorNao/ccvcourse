### Linear Operators

Image is matrix can be represented as a $I[m \cdot n]$, using T.S.exp we can compute derivitaive matrix as a $dI/dx_{i, j} = I_{i,j+1} - I_{i,j-1}$

Linear filters means linear combination of neighbooring pixel values, examples:
- smoothing with averaging
- smoothing with Gaussian
- finding a derivative

Prescription for the linear combination is called the "convolution kernel"

#### Convolution (2d)

Given kernel $f$ ang image $h$.
Conv $f \cdot h$ is defined as: \
$h(x, y) \ cdot f(x, y) = \int_{v} \int_{u} h(x - u, y - v) f(u, v) du dv = \sum_{i} \sum_{j} h[x - i, y - j] f[i, j]$

!N.B: We need to rotate kernel for 180 degrees

What about border handling?
Methods: 
1. Zero padding
